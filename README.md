## 🔑 API Key Information

This project uses the [TMDB (The Movie Database)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API to fetch movie data.

-   I've included **my own API key** in the project for quick access and testing.
-   However, if the app doesn't load movie data (possibly due to request limits or key restrictions), you can easily get your **own free TMDB API key**:
